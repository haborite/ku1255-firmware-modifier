# KU-1255 Firmware Modifier

A simple GUI tool for customizing the firmware of the **[Lenovo ThinkPad Compact USB Keyboard with TrackPoint](https://support.lenovo.com/jp/ja/solutions/pd026745-thinkpad-compact-usb-keyboard-with-trackpoint-overview-and-service-parts)**.  
You can remap any key on the keyboard‚Äîfor example, reassign the `Ctrl` key to the `Fn` key position in the bottom-left corner. You can also increase the TrackPoint speed beyond the limitation of Lenovo driver settings.

Since all modifications are written directly to the keyboard's firmware, **no system-side configuration is required**. The layout remains consistent across all connected devices and operating systems.

## üìú Compatible Models
**[Lenovo ThinkPad Compact USB Keyboard with TrackPoint (KU-1255)](https://support.lenovo.com/jp/ja/solutions/pd026745-thinkpad-compact-usb-keyboard-with-trackpoint-overview-and-service-parts)**

**Part Number** : 0B47190, 0B47191, 0B47192, 0B47194, 0B47195, 0B47197, 0B47198, 0B47200, 0B47201, 0B47202, 0B47204, 0B47205, 0B47206, 0B47207, 0B47208, 0B47209, 0B47210, 0B47211, 0B47212, 0B47213, 0B47215, 0B47216, 0B47217, 0B47218, 0B47219, 0B47220, 0B47221, 0B47222, 0B47223, 0B47224, 0B47225

## ‚úÖ System Requirements

- Currently the app only works on MS Windows, but macOS and Linux versions can be developed upon request.
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is required in MS Windows.
- Once the firmware is installed, the keyboard works on **most operating systems**, regardless of the one used during installation.
- Internet connection is required at the first run of the app to download the official firmware installer from Lenovo web page.

## üöÄ How to Download and Run

1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/haborite/ku1255-firmware-modifier/releases/latest) of `ku1255-firmware-modifier.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/haborite/ku1255-firmware-modifier/releases/latest) page.
2. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file.
3. Launch `ku1255-firmware-modifier.exe`.
    - If you see a warning saying "Windows protected your PC" and "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting", click "More info" and then select "Run anyway" to proceed.

## üñ•Ô∏è Interface Overview

1. **Keyboard Selection**  
   Choose your keyboard model. For US layout, select: `0B47190 (84 keys - ANSI)`

2. **Language Selection**  
   Choose your preferred language. Select `US / English` for a typical US keyboard layout.

3. **Main Layer**  
   Defines the default keymap. Click any key to change it, and select a key you want to newly map from the dropdown.

4. **2nd Layer**  
   Defines key behavior when used with the **Mod** key.  
   - This layer is disabled by default because the Mod key isn‚Äôt initially mapped in the Main Layer.
   - The Mod key must be assigned in both Main and 2nd layers at the same position.

5. **TrackPoint Speed**  
   Set the trackpoint speed (default: 1). This has nothing to do with Lenovo driver settings or OS mouse settings. It is better to adjust these two settings first before modifying this firmware.

6. **Load config**  
   Load a previously saved keymap from a `.json` file.

7. **Save config**  
   Save the current keymap to a `.json` file.

8. **Install firmware**  
   Flash the current configuration to the keyboard.  
   Make sure the keyboard is plugged in before proceeding.  
   After installation, unplug and reconnect the keyboard to apply the changes.

## üîß Example: Swapping Fn and Ctrl Keys

1. Click `Load config` and open the file: `example/Swap-Fn-Ctrl.json`
2. In the **Main Layer**, verify that the `Fn` and `Left Ctrl` keys are swapped.  
   (Swapped keys will be highlighted in blue.)
3. Click `Install firmware`.
4. When the firmware installer launches, click **Start**.
5. After installation finishes, close the installer.
6. Unplug and reconnect the keyboard. The new keymap will take effect.
